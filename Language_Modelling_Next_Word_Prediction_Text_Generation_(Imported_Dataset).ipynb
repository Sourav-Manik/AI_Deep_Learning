            "to cook, so she went into the kitchen and tried and tried, but she\n",
            "could not understand the cookery books, and she made dreadful messes,\n",
            "and spoiled her frocks, and burned her fingers till she cried and cried.\n",
            "\n",
            "One day she went to her grandmother and her mother and her Pretty Aunt\n",
            "and her Other Aunt, who were all sitting sewing, and asked them to tell\n",
            "her about cooking.\n",
            "\n",
            "“What is a roux,” she said, “and what’s a mousse and what’s an entrée?\n",
            "What are timbales and sautés and ingredients, and how do you mix them\n",
            "and how long do you bake them? Won’t somebody please tell me all about\n",
            "it?”\n",
            "\n",
            "And her Pretty Aunt said, “See the flour all over that new frock!” and\n",
            "her mother said, “Dear child, you are not old enough to cook yet”;\n",
            "and her grandmother said, “Just wait a year or two, and I’ll teach\n",
            "you myself”; and her Other Aunt said, “Some day you shall go to the\n",
            "cookery-school and learn everything; you know little girls can’t cook.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But Margaret said, “I don’t want to wait till I’m big; I want to cook\n",
            "now; and I don’t want to do cookery-school cooking, but little girl\n",
            "cooking, all by myself.”\n",
            "\n",
            "So she kept on trying to learn, but she burned her fingers and spoiled\n",
            "her dresses worse than ever, and her messes were so bad they had to be\n",
            "thrown away, every one of them; and she cried and cried. And then one\n",
            "day her grandmother said, “It’s a shame that child should not learn\n",
            "to cook if she really wants to so much”; and her mother said, “Yes, it\n",
            "is a shame, and she shall learn! Let’s get her a small table and some\n",
            "tins and aprons, and make her a little cookery-book all her own, out\n",
            "of the old ones we wrote for ourselves long ago--just the plain, easy\n",
            "things anybody can make.” And both her aunts said, “Do! We will help,\n",
            "and perhaps we might put in just a few cookery-school things beside.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It was not long after this that Margaret had a birthday, and she\n",
            "was taken to the kitchen to get her presents, which she thought the\n",
            "funniest thing in the world. There they all were, in the middle of the\n",
            "room: first her father’s present, a little table with a white oil-cloth\n",
            "cover and castors, which would push right under the big table when it\n",
            "was not being used. Over a chair her grandmother’s present, three nice\n",
            "gingham aprons, with sleeves and ruffled bibs. On the little table\n",
            "the presents of the aunties, shiny new tins and saucepans, and cups to\n",
            "measure with, and spoons, and a toasting-fork, and ever so many things;\n",
            "and then on one corner of the table, all by itself, was her mother’s\n",
            "present, her own little cookery-book, with her own name on it, and that\n",

            "scalloped patty-pans round them, and the real egg-beater in front of\n",
            "all, just like a picture, and then she read a page in her cookery-book,\n",
            "and began to believe it was all true. So she danced for joy, and put on\n",
